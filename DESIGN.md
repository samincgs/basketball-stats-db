## Scope

In this section you should answer the following questions:

### Purpose

I am a big fan of the NBA and basketball, so I wanted to create a SQL database to store all information about a regular NBA season. This database is designed to track basketball teams, players, games, and player performance statistics over multiple seasons. It allows users to store, organize, and query data such as player stats per game, team performance, and season records.

### Inside the Scope

- **Players:** Personal details such as first name, last name, position, height, weight, and team association.
- **Teams:** Name, city, coach, and home court.
- **Seasons:** Start and end dates, year of the season.
- **Games:** Home and away teams, game date, scores, and season association.
- **Player statistics:** Points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, fouls, and minutes played for each game.

### Outside the Scope

- **Detailed historical injury data, player contracts, or salaries.**
- **Off-court events or personal life information about players.**
- **Live tracking of games or real-time updates.**

## Functional Requirements

In this section you should answer the following questions:

- What should a user be able to do with your database?
- What's beyond the scope of what a user should be able to do with your database?

## Representation

### Entities

In this section you should answer the following questions:

- Which entities will you choose to represent in your database?
- What attributes will those entities have?
- Why did you choose the types you did?
- Why did you choose the constraints you did?

### Relationships

In this section you should include your entity relationship diagram and describe the relationships between the entities in your database.

## Optimizations

In this section you should answer the following questions:

- Which optimizations (e.g., indexes, views) did you create? Why?

## Limitations

In this section you should answer the following questions:

- What are the limitations of your design?
- What might your database not be able to represent very well?

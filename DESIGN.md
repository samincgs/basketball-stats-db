## Scope

### Purpose

I am a big fan of the NBA and basketball, so I wanted to create a SQL database to store information about a regular NBA season. This database is designed to track basketball teams, players, games, and player performance statistics over multiple seasons. It allows users to store, organize, and query data such as player stats per game, team performance, and season records.

### Inside the Scope

- **Players:** Personal details such as first name, last name, position, height, weight, and team association.
- **Teams:** Name, city, coach, and home court.
- **Seasons:** Start and end dates, year of the season.
- **Games:** Home and away teams, game date, scores, and season association.
- **Player statistics:** Points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, fouls, and minutes played for each game.

### Outside the Scope

- **Historical injury data or salaries.**
- **Personal life information about players.**
- **Real time updates for games.**

## Functional Requirements

### User Capabilities

- Add, update, or delete teams, players, seasons, and games.
- Record player statistics for individual games.
- Query total stats for a player across games or within a season.
- Query team scores and game results.
- Identify top scorers, rebounders, or other performance leaders.
- Retrieve game schedules for a specific team or season.

### Beyond the Scope

- Real-time tracking of games or live updates.
- Predictive analytics or machine learning projections.
- Visualization dashboards or graphical reports.

## Representation

### Entities

#### ER Diagram

![ER Diagram](er-diagram.png)

The entities in this database represent the core components of a basketball tracking system. Each entity captures a different aspect of the league: players, teams, seasons, games, and player statistics.

**Players**  
The Players entity stores attributes such as `first_name`, `last_name`, `position`, `height_cm`, and `weight_kg`, along with a `team_id` foreign key to link each player to their team. The chosen data types are `VARCHAR` for names, `ENUM` for positions to ensure only valid roles can be entered, `INT` for height, and `DECIMAL` for weight to allow fractional precision. Constraints such as `NOT NULL` ensure that essential player details are always present.

**Teams**  
The Teams entity includes attributes like `name`, `city`, `coach`, and `court_name`. These are stored as `VARCHAR` fields to support text data of variable length. A `PRIMARY KEY` on the `id` ensures each team can be uniquely identified, and the team name and city combination prevents ambiguity between teams.

**Seasons**  
The Seasons entity tracks the `year`, `start_date`, and `end_date` of each season. The `year` is marked as `UNIQUE` to prevent duplicate seasons, while `DATE` types are used to ensure accurate time-based queries.

**Games**  
The Games entity includes `game_date`, `home_team_id`, `away_team_id`, `score_home`, `score_away`, and `season_id`. `DATE` ensures proper handling of the game schedule, while integer fields track team scores. Foreign keys to `teams` and `seasons` maintain referential integrity so every game links back to valid teams and a valid season.

**Player_Stats**  
The Player_Stats entity captures a playerâ€™s performance in a single game. It contains attributes such as `points`, `rebounds`, `assists`, `steals`, `blocks`, `fouls`, and `minutes_played`. These are stored as `INT` or `DECIMAL` depending on whether fractional values are possible (e.g., `minutes_played` as `DECIMAL(4,1)`). A `UNIQUE(player_id, game_id)` constraint ensures that each player has at most one stats entry per game, preventing duplication.

The chosen data types and constraints across all entities were selected to balance accuracy, integrity, and efficiency. `INT` and `DECIMAL` are used for numerical data, `VARCHAR` for text fields, and `ENUM` for limited sets of categorical data. Foreign keys and uniqueness constraints ensure strong referential integrity while avoiding inconsistent or duplicate records.

### Relationships

The database is designed with clear relationships between its entities to accurately represent basketball teams, players, games, seasons, and player statistics. Each team can have many players, establishing a one to many relationship between the `teams` and `players` tables. Similarly, each season can include many games, creating a one to many relationship between `seasons` and `games`. The `games` table connects to teams twice, once for the home team and once for the away team, reflecting which teams participated in each game. Players participate in many games, and each game includes many players, which forms a many to many relationship between `players` and `games`. This relationship is implemented through the `player_stats` table, which serves as a bridge table storing performance data for each player in each game. Foreign keys enforce referential integrity across the database, ensuring that all player stats are linked to valid players and games, and all games are associated with existing teams and seasons. Overall, these relationships allow the database to accurately model team rosters, game schedules, player performance, and seasonal statistics.

## Optimizations

To improve the performance of the database, several optimizations were implemented. Indexes were created on the `player_stats` table to speed up common queries. An index on `player_id` allows for fast retrieval of all statistics for a specific player, while an index on `game_id` allows quick access to all player statistics for a particular game. Overall, these optimizations help maintain both speed and accuracy when querying player performance, team results, and season statistics. I only have one view that I commonly used. The `player_totals_by_season` view is an optimization that simplifies and speeds up queries for player performance over a season. Rather than writing a complex query each time to calculate total points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and minutes played, this view pre-aggregates the data by player and season.

## Limitations

The database does not support real-time game tracking or live updates. It does not store detailed historical player injuries, contracts, salaries, or off-court events. Team and player transfers mid-season are not tracked in detail, as the database assumes static team membership per record. Advanced basketball analytics, such as player efficiency ratings, plus-minus, or advanced shooting metrics, are not included. Changes in team names, arenas, or coaching staff over time may be difficult to represent without additional tables or historical tracking. Overall, the database is primarily focused on standard box score statistics and may not capture every nuance of a game or player performance.
